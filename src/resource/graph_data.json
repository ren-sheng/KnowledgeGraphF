His research spans a wide range of urological and oncological topics, including prostate and bladder cancer. Specifically, BASIRI has co-authored studies examining Gleason score discrepancies in prostate cancer, bladder cancer prognosis, and prostate cancer risk prediction using single nucleotide polymorphisms. He has also contributed to research on nanocurcumin in bladder cancer and has authored studies on surgical techniques such as endoscopic dilatation of meatal stenosis of ureterocele in adult patients, single umbilical stoma for bilateral ureterostomy after radical cystectomy, and the necessity of a safety guide wire during transurethral lithotripsy using a semi-rigid ureteroscope. His work is consistently grounded in the academic and clinical environments of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and its associated research centers.",
